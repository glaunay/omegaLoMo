Finding new interactions between proteins in a proteome, based on sequence homology.

## Getting Started

Follow instructions below to make a version of OmegaLoMo run on your computer.

### Prerequisites


This pipeline is currently using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to work.

It also uses [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) and more particularly these packages :


```python
import sys
import networkx as nx
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import copy
import json
```


### Installing

First of all, you have to download the full package.

The first step is to clone the git repository. In order to do that, open a terminal console and write this command line :

```
git clone https://github.com/glaunay/omegaLoMo.git 
```

Import the package to your .py project

```
import PACKAGE_PATH.core as core
import PACKAGE_PATH.createTopo as cT
import PACKAGE_PATH.graph as graph
import PACKAGE_PATH.smallWork as sW
```






## Running the tests

After downloading the package and the serialized data, check the Run_Analsis jupyter notebook in order to use the pipeline.

Serialized files contain :

>indexR6

>>List of the full proteome of our organism

>newDic.json

>>Dictionnary containing all interaction extracted from Intact (physical interactions with Uniprot ID)

>FullOmegaSet_coverage.json

>>Contains all information required to build the graph

>divKnownR6.txt

>> <div><a href=http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=taxonomy:%22Streptococcus%20pneumoniae%20(strain%20ATCC%20BAA-255%20/%20R6)%20[171101]%22+go:51301> File download from uniprot </a></div>



At the end, you should be able to observe some graphs corresponding to the first neighbors of each proteins of interest.

These are the proteins-proteins predicted interactions in the genome of your organism.


## Deployment

If you want to use this pipeline with your own data set, make sure to check all input format.
